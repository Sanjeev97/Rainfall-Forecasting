# Rainfall-Forecasting
This repository contains a machine learning model for forecasting monthly rainfall using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The model leverages multiple meteorological parameters including precipitation history, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed to make accurate predictions of future rainfall patterns.
Overview
Rainfall forecasting is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, flood prevention, and urban planning. This project implements a deep learning approach to predict monthly precipitation based on historical weather data.
Key features:

Time series forecasting using LSTM neural networks
Multivariate analysis incorporating multiple weather parameters
Data preprocessing and feature engineering for meteorological data
Model evaluation with various performance metrics
Visualization of predictions vs actual rainfall

Dataset
The model is trained on monthly weather data with the following parameters:

Precipitation (mm)
Temperature (Â°C)
Relative Humidity (%)
Wind Speed (km/h)
